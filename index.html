                            Play a card from your hand by placing it FACE UP on top of the Discard Pile, and following the instructions on the card. Or play no cards at all; that's cool too.</p>

                        <p>
                            After you follow the instructions on a card or play a Pair, you can play more cards. You can play as many cards as you'd like.</p>

                            Finally, end your turn by drawing a card from the Draw Pile into your hand and hoping it's not an Exploding Kitten.<br>
                            (This is different from most other games in that you END YOUR TURN by drawing a card.)

                            Play continues clockwise around the table.
